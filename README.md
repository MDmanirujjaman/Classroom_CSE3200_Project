# Classroom CSE3200 Project

I created a robust and secure online platform that empowers educators to effortlessly share class resources with designated students, maintaining the confidentiality and exclusivity of the content. The system incorporates a sophisticated access control mechanism, utilizing individualized "class codes" to guarantee that educational materials are accessible solely to authorized individuals. This solution enhances the efficiency of educational content distribution while preserving the integrity of educational materials and ensuring they reach only the intended recipients.
